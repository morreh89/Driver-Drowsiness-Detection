# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Developed a real-time drowsiness detection algorithm that uses a webcam.

# Project Description
Road accidents are a major public health problem globally. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 1.2 million deaths and 10 million injuries due to road accidents around the world annually. 
These numbers are staggering and ultimately impact the economy in different ways. 
In Kenya for instance, WHO estimated that the country lost US$4 billion in 2011 due to road traffic fatalities; this loss was approximately 11% of the GDP.

Fatigue, which is often characterized by drowsiness, has been attributed as the one of the main causes of road accidents. 
In different surveys conducted in the past, 30% of people reported dozing off while behing the wheel. 
Driving while drowsy means that one is four times more likely to be involved in a crash. As such, this project highly relevant in today's society. 
Being able to predict drowsiness among drivers in real time can prevent road accidents since the driver can be warned by an alarm and he/she can therefore take appropriate measures to stop driving.
